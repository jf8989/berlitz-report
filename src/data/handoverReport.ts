### Teacher's Handover Report: Philosophy and Student Insights

**Prepared by: Juan Francisco Marcenaro Arellano (Juanfra)**

#### About My Teaching Philosophy

My approach in the classroom is centered on creating a dynamic, welcoming, and effective learning environment. I believe that confidence is the key to fluency, and I work to build strong rapport with students to help them develop an efficient and positive mindset for their studies.

To achieve this, I integrate a few key practices:

*   **Humor and Rapport:** I consistently use humor to make everyone feel comfortable and to build a strong sense of community. A lighthearted atmosphere lowers the anxiety often associated with language learning.
*   **The "Nicole Kidman Claps":** A signature element of my classes is the "Nicole Kidman Claps," derived from a popular meme. This became our shared symbol for a job well done. It was so effective that students began using it to encourage their classmates, creating a wonderfully supportive peer-to-peer feedback loop.
*   **The "Perfect Prank":** A running joke that my students loved was something I learned from a Bulgarian director I worked with. Whenever a student would say, "Alright, perfect," I would respond with, "No, no, I know, but please call me Juanfra." It was a simple, memorable way to reinforce a friendly and approachable dynamic.
*   **Student-Led Teaching:** To foster critical thinking and ownership, I frequently had students take control of my computer to lead exercises. This "teacher role" encourages them to collaborate and devise creative solutions to achieve learning goals. I would help when they needed a little push but would usually refrain from intervening until they had finished their process.

Overall, my goal was to create an environment where students could not only learn English but also feel genuinely seen, supported, and cared for.

### Group & Student-Specific Notes

#### Megalabs Lv7
*   **Lara:** An excellent student with high fluency, strong comprehension, and sharp critical thinking skills. She has a great attitude and a wonderful sense of humor. A notable environmental challenge is her colleague, Patty, who often takes loud videocalls in Spanish nearby during Lara's English class.
*   **Milagros:** A strong, fluent student with good listening skills, though she can occasionally be confused by grammatical nuances. She has a great attitude. It's worth noting a past issue with punctuality; she used to connect while driving. This was addressed with our director, Almary, and she has since stopped. However, her absences have increased recently. She is also an entrepreneur.
*   **Rafael:** Has a great attitude in class but has struggled with attendance. His performance is adequate, but he faces significant grammatical challenges that are best addressed outside of a group setting. I recommend one-on-one tutorials and perhaps a diagnostic test to pinpoint these deficiencies.
*   **Santiago:** Exceptionally intelligent and critical, with fantastic communication skills, much like Lara. He brings a great sense of humor and a sunny, receptive attitude to every class.
*   **Valentina:** Has a very pleasant and sunny disposition, though she can be more reserved. Her sense of humor differs from her peers, even though she is the head of "Inclusion" at their company. She is a very smart and engaged student with solid grammar and fluency. Attendance can be an area for improvement.
*   **Gustavo:** A new student who transferred from another group. He is bright but can be anxious, often providing highly complex answers to simple questions. This can affect class pacing and requires gentle guidance to maintain momentum. He responds well to being taken seriously and feeling welcome, and he has expressed that he is enjoying this group.

#### BASF Lv7
This is one of my longest-standing groups; I've been with some of them for several levels. During our last class, they executed a wonderful surprise. They initially pretended their cameras were broken, then simultaneously turned them on to reveal a custom background they had created. It was a collage of my face, messages wishing me luck, a "You're perfect!" note (a nod to our running joke), and a "Nicole Kidman claps for him!" banner. It was an amazing moment, and a screenshot of it can be seen here: /images/basf7.jpg.
*   **Alejandra:** Highly intelligent with a great attitude and an amazing sense of humor (she's a *Friends* fan, and her boyfriend makes excellent lasagna). Her fluency and grammar are strong, with only minor, infrequent confusion between past and present tenses. I’ve been teaching her since Level 6.
*   **Camila:** An entrepreneur who is very smart, has a fantastic sense of humor, and is a great team player. She is an amazing improviser during performances and has an excellent, natural-sounding English accent. This was my first level teaching her.
*   **Cecilia:** The "wondergirl" of the class. She is universally loved and is everyone's favorite partner, always bringing a smile. Her fluency is good, but she has some grammatical patterns to work on, such as using the present tense for the past and overextending sentences during performances. This is likely due to limited exposure to English outside of class. I’ve been teaching her since Level 5.
*   **Pilar:** Her linguistic profile is quite similar to Cecilia's. She is also a fluent Portuguese speaker. She has a great attitude, manages a team, practices Reiki, and loves Caipirinhas. I’ve been teaching her since Level 5.
*   **Sofia:** A great student who is very effective at solving exercises, though she is sometimes tired. She appreciates concise, to-the-point exercises and explanations. She is a lovely person. This was my first level teaching her.
*   **Vanessa:** My longest-tenured student in this group; I’ve taught her since Level 3. She has made dramatic progress over time. While she still occasionally struggles with prepositions ("to," "for") and pronouns ("me"), her fluency, grammar, and listening skills have improved immensely. Increasing her exposure to English outside of class would be beneficial.

#### Karina Bianchi Lv 2 (Private Student)
*   **Karina:** When Karina started, she believed she was not good at English and would be a "headache." I focused heavily on building her confidence. While she has limited exposure to English outside of class, she is very intelligent and grasps grammar concepts clearly when they are explained. She struggles a bit when the material is not in sight, but she perseveres. Her listening skills are still developing and require further training.

#### Omaha Lv 1
This group expressed their gratitude for providing a safe and positive learning space.
*   **Leonardo:** A quiet student who understands exercises and performs reasonably well. He can be very distracted, even when it doesn't appear so. I found that asking him to repeat instructions or phrases up to three times was necessary for the information to sink in, as he tends to omit words.
*   **Ana:** An amazing student. Despite her demanding university schedule, she prioritized the class because she valued the group dynamic. She was navigating some personal challenges, and I encouraged her to attend even when feeling emotionally unavailable, reminding her that we are people first, students and teachers second. She has excellent retention when focused but can sometimes struggle with new vocabulary. Patience is key.
*   **Leicy:** Started the course late. She reported that she did not receive the start date information, materials, or links from her contact (Mike) until the third week of class. She has a good understanding when concepts are explained patiently, often with the help of body language. Despite missing the initial classes, she is engaged and steadily improving.

#### Arlington
This group also thanked me for creating a safe and enjoyable class environment.
*   **Jonathan:** Has a great sense of humor and expressed his gratitude for the "pronunciation hacks" and for being able to understand concepts he previously missed. His main challenge is that he often connects via his phone, which makes following the material more difficult. He is a great student, provided he isn't watching football simultaneously! He is moving to Spain very soon.
*   **Karina:** A special case requiring significant support. Due to a demanding teaching job, being the sole caretaker for her children, and getting very little sleep (4-5 hours a night), her attendance and energy levels have been very low. Compounded by zero prior English knowledge or outside exposure, her language production is very basic. Despite these immense challenges, she made a small recovery near the end, slightly improving her grammar. Unfortunately, she will not be passing the course. She has potential, but it would be best for her to restart the level from the beginning, when the foundational concepts are taught.
*   **Roxana:** A very smart and responsible student with a great sense of humor. Her side exposure to English is noticeable in her performance. Like any Level 1 student, she sometimes struggles with grammar, but these are typically easy fixes.

#### BASF Lv2
I covered a class for Eliane, Florencia, and Kayla previously, and I believe they requested me for this level. This is a larger group with varying proficiency levels, which made pacing a challenge. A couple of cancellations on my part also disrupted the flow.
*   **Christiane:** A Brazilian student with amazing fluency, grammar, and vocabulary, indicating significant prior exposure or diligent study. She is aware she is ahead of her classmates and once privately shared that she holds back from participating so others don't feel discouraged. I reassured her that I would manage the classroom dynamic to address this.
*   **Fabio:** A good student who is very funny. His fluency is sometimes hampered by filler words ("ehhhh," "uhhh"), and he occasionally makes mistakes with past tense verbs.
*   **Fernando:** Tries his best and has a great sense of humor and a sunny attitude. He sometimes confuses articles and misuses pronouns after verbs (e.g., "me" instead of "I"). These are easy to correct, but he needs to work on pronunciation.
*   **Eliane:** Lacked confidence and asked for advice on improving her comprehension. I recommended more English consumption and booking tutorials. Her fluency is good when she feels certain, but she is afraid to speak when unsure.
*   **Florencia:** A great student, always with a smile. She has good fluency and a great habit of asking clarifying questions with on-the-spot examples, which are usually correct. She has excellent intuition.
*   **Kayla:** The most shy student in the group. Her pronunciation is excellent, a clear sign of exposure to the language. She is very self-critical and benefits from direct, hand-in-hand guidance and reassurance. She is a very sensitive individual.

#### Soledad Lv 5 (Private Student)
*   **Soledad:** A very intelligent student who struggles to access her knowledge during speaking, likely due to a lack of exposure outside of class. Frequent interruptions from others during her class sessions also hinder her progress. As we only had one hour per week, my observation is that she is a serious student who was slowly beginning to open up.

#### Alur Lv6 (Private Student)
*   **Walter:** An amazing student who proves that it's never too late to learn. While his speaking isn't perfect, it is perfectly understandable. He diligently does his homework and recursively uses new vocabulary in subsequent classes, demonstrating real learning. He is a wonderful person with great improvisation skills and is very punctual. It was a pleasure to have him as a student.

#### Beca Lv1
I've had this group since last year, but a long holiday break created a significant continuity issue.
*   **Alejandro:** Has good comprehension but needs more practice. His pronunciation is improving steadily; for example, he is getting used to the correct sound of the article "a" versus the letter "e." This is normal for a student completely new to the language.
*   **Gimena:** Was doing great but unfortunately left the company and did not return after the break.
*   **Melina:** Started with very little confidence, but I worked to show her how capable she is. She has responded well to my "pronunciation hacks." Her overall understanding of the material has improved.

#### Fresno Lv5
This group had several absences, which caused us to fall behind the intended pace. I also had to cancel on them once or twice.
*   **Ana Laura:** A great student with a good sense of humor, strong fluency, and rich vocabulary. Her main challenge is a reluctance to accept new grammar structures that "feel weird," which can make teaching more difficult. She once had a very difficult day (a fall, a health scare, and a sick pet) and was emotionally indisposed. We had a chat that reframed her perspective, and we managed to productively complete half a unit, which was a success given the circumstances.
*   **Victoria:** A great student with a positive attitude who was very motivated to figure things out on her own. Unfortunately, due to personal matters, she was absent for an extended period and ultimately decided not to return. She expressed that saying goodbye would have been too difficult emotionally and that she needed time off to get well.

#### Megalabs Lv4
A new group for me, using a new curriculum. Per my mentor Riana's advice, I've been selectively skipping exercises that are overly mathematical. The students have been enjoying the classes, and we connected very well.
*   **Analia:** She is pregnant and has missed recent classes for medical appointments. She is a very responsible student with good listening and speaking skills.
*   **Luisa:** An amazing student with a smile that can wake up a room. Her English is very strong for Level 4, she has great listening skills, and she is very reflective about her learning process. She loves the "Nicole Kidman Claps."
*   **Maia:** A very fun and bold student who loves to speak, even inventing words when she lacks the vocabulary. She is very willing to learn but would benefit from more exposure to English outside of class. She was recently absent for a vacation in Chile.
*   **Thalia:** Never attended class; she was reportedly on vacation for the entire duration.
*   **Valeria:** An amazing student who is balancing work and university. Her boss sometimes calls during class, and attendance can be a challenge. Despite this, she is very hardworking, loves the class dynamics, and gets along well with her classmates.

#### Navios Terminales Lv1
This was my first all-male group, and we got along very well. They expressed how much they enjoyed the classes on our last day.
*   **Cristian:** Has been absent for the last two classes but is a touch above his peers in fluency and his ability to acquire new vocabulary and grammar.
*   **Darwins:** From Maracay, Venezuela. He has had significant outside exposure to English. He grasps concepts quickly and enjoys challenging himself. It's important to manage his curiosity, as he sometimes asks about advanced topics that could confuse his classmates.
*   **Miguel:** Also from Venezuela. He is slightly behind his peers but is very happy to learn and challenge himself. His main issues are frequent interruptions from work during class and occasional tardiness. He has the potential to succeed if he can improve on these points.

#### Patricia Lv5 (Private Student)
*   **Patricia:** As a fellow Backstreet Boys fan, we got on well from the start. She has told me she feels very comfortable in our classes. She is so intelligent that it's easy to synthesize units and move on quickly. My main focus with her has been on correcting her use of present/past tenses in speech. She is a great student but also loves to talk; this is a great opportunity to ask her questions related to the grammar topic of the day or to adapt the speaking goal to her interests.

#### Final Thoughts & Acknowledgements

My primary objective has always been to ensure that students truly understand what they are learning, can use it meaningfully, and see my class as a safe space for self-expression.

The feedback and support from Natalia, Almary, and Riana have been priceless during my time here. I look forward to the possibility of our paths crossing again and hope to have the opportunity to teach with Berlitz in the future, should they have me back.
